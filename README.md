# EagleBallot
EagleBallot is a real-time remote voting web app that allows voters to cast their votes in real-time leveraging technology to enable voters to participate from their locations using electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, or tablets, during a specified voting window. Unlike traditional remote voting systems where votes are collected and counted after the voting period ends, real-time remote voting systems provide immediate results on the votes cast.

##  Key Features and Considerations
- Online Platform: A real-time remote voting system typically operates through an online platform accessible to voters. This platform can be a website or a dedicated application that allows voters to securely log in and cast their votes.

- Real-Time Feedback: One of the main advantages of a real-time remote voting system is that it provides instant feedback to voters. They can see their vote being recorded and real-time results or updates during the voting process.

- Security and Authentication: As with any remote voting system, security and authentication measures are crucial. Strong authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication, can help verify the identity of voters and prevent fraudulent activities.

- Encryption and Data Protection: Real-time remote voting systems should utilize strong encryption techniques to protect the integrity and confidentiality of voter data and ensure that votes remain secure during transmission and storage.

- Scalability: A real-time remote voting system needs to be able to handle a large number of simultaneous voters, especially during peak voting periods. Scalability considerations are essential to ensure smooth operation without disruptions or system failures.

- Auditability and Transparency: To maintain transparency and trust in the voting process, real-time remote voting systems should incorporate mechanisms for auditing and verifying the votes. This may include cryptographic techniques and the ability to generate an auditable trail for post-voting scrutiny.

- Accessibility: Ensuring accessibility for all voters is crucial in a real-time remote voting system. The platform should be designed with user-friendly interfaces and accommodate individuals with disabilities or limited technical expertise.

- Legal and Regulatory Compliance: It must adhere to relevant legal and regulatory requirements specific to the jurisdiction where they are deployed. Compliance with data protection laws and regulations is particularly important to protect voter privacy.


###  This project is focused on tackling vote buying, double voting, voter impersonation, and threats to the security of life and property.
